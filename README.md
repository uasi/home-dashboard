This is not something that will be useful to you, but the internals might be interesting.

## Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
ADMIN_PASSWORD=*** deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
